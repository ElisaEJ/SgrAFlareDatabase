### HTML table of Sgr A* flares

For each observation containing a flare, we show the ObsID, the date of the start of the flare, the telescope which made the observation, the instrument mode, the exposure (the total length of each Bayesian Block), the authors who analysed the data, the quiescent count rate, the start and end times of each flare in MJD, the duration of each flare, the mean count rate, the peak count rate obtained with 300s bins, the emitted energy (in units of 10^37 erg), the flux (in units of 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2), the fluence (in units of 10^-9 erg cm^-2) and the luminosity (in units of 10^34 erg). We also include download links for the fits files and the plots of the light curves. 

All count rates and emitted energies are from 2-8keV. Sgr A*'s extraction region is a small 1.25" circular region centred around the radio position of Sgr A* (17h45m40.04909s, -29◦00’28.118"). When defining the region in ds9 we noticed that for some observations Sgr A* was a little outside this region so we changed slightly the RA and Dec accordingly.

It should be noted that all observations we analyzed here do not involve pile-up corrections.
